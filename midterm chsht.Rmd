Interactions:
f(x) = beta0 + beta1(x1) + beta2(x2) + beta3(x1*x2)
interpreting beta3: the difference between slopes for a 1 unit change in x2.
test H0: beta3 = 0
multiple-partial F-test: test for interaction. pr(>F) > threshold, drop.

Residuals:
in linear model a plot of error vs f(x) should show no pattern.
if error SD is constant, variation i residuals vs f(x) should look roughly equal.

Unusual obs:
studentized residuals -- outliers
Leverage(hi) -- atypical obs  hi > 2(p+1)/n  >3(p+1)/n
cook's dist -- influnce of an obs

Q-Q plot:
if heavier tailed than t-distribution, miss some vars explain the dependent var
